# Speech to Morse code translator

## How it Works

This project translates human speech into morse code via light source. Speech is input using a microphone, processed by the Google Assistant, and then python converts the text into morse code and outputs the code with a light source.

### Branch Content
This branch contains Python files that use Arduino/RaspberryPi GPIO pins to output light version of Morse Code messages. There is also an example file from https://github.com/googlesamples/assistant-sdk-python for how to use the Google Assistant Library in Python.
